The product is still in its early development stage, but my hope is that its popularity as long as the list of features will grow abundantly the years to come.\r\n\r\nHere is the initial list of features:\r\n- Automatically scans all disk drives and network shares for valid audio, pictures and videos.\r\n- Automatically organizes all media files by their location.\r\n- Automatically gets TV Show episode details from the tvrage.com API.\r\n- Automatically gets Movie details from the themoviedb.org API.\r\n- Supports navigation using both a media center remote control and using a keyboard and mouse.\r\n- Media can be browsed by navigating through the directory structures.\r\n- Media can be searched using a normal keyboard or using the on-screen keyboard.\r\n- Media can be organized and searched using playlist tags.\r\n- Allows editing the Tag properties of MP3 files, including the cover image.\r\n- Audio and Video files continue to play the next media file as long as there are more media files in either the directory, search result or playlist.\r\n- Supports playing almost all video files including 1080p Full HD thanks to the power of the LibVLC Library.\r\n- Video files support displaying both built-in subtitles as well as external SRT and SUB subtitle files.\r\n\r\nSupported Audio Files:\r\nAAC, AIF, IFF, M4A, MID, MP3, MPA, WAV, WMA\r\n\r\nSupported Picture/Image Files:\r\nBMP, GIF, JPG, PNG, PSD, TIF\r\n\r\nSupported Video Files:\r\n3G2, 3GP, ASF, ASX, AVI, FLV, M2TS, M4V, MKV, MOV, MP4, MPG, SWF, VOB, WMV\r\n\r\nThis software was built using the following Build Environment:\r\n\r\n.NET Framework 4\t\t4.0.30319 SP1\r\nDoxyGen\t\t\t\t1.8.0\t\tDocumentation Builder\r\nJenkins\t\t\t\t1.443\t\tContinuous Integration Tool\r\nMakeNSIS\t\t\t2.46\t\tNSIS Software Installer Builder\r\nNAnt\t\t\t\t0.91\t\tNAnt Software Project Builder\r\nMSBuild Engine 4\t\t4.0.30319.1\tMSBuild .NET Project Builder\r\nWANdisco uberSVN\t\t11.12 SVN 1.6\tSVN Server\r\n\r\nThis software was tested in the following Operating Systems:\r\n\r\nWindows\tXP\tProfessional\tSP3\tx86\r\nWindows\tVista\tHome Basic\t\tx86\r\nWindows\t7\tHome Premium\t\tx64\r\n\r\nThis software includes the following 3rd Party Software:\r\n\r\nLibVLC 1.1.9\r\nMediaInfo DLL 0.7.51\r\nMicrosoft .NET Framework 4.0\r\nMicrosoft SQL Server Compact 4.0\r\nMovie Thumbnailer 200808a\r\nTagLib# 2.1.0.0\r\n\r\nMinimum Requirements:\r\n\r\nScreen Resolution\t1600x900 (HD)\r\nDisk Space\t\t200-500 MB\r\nMemory\t\t\t1 GB\r\nCPU\t\t\tDual Core 2.0 GHz\r\nInternet Connection\tBroadband (xDSL, Cable etc.)\r\n\r\nRecommended Requirements:\r\n\r\nScreen Resolution\t1920x1080 (Full HD)\r\nDisk Space\t\t1-2 GB for Movie and TV Show images etc.\r\nMemory\t\t\t1 GB\r\nCPU\t\t\tQuad Core 2.0 GHz\r\nInternet Connection\tBroadband (xDSL, Cable etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground Image: http://invilab.com/blog/?page_id=228\r\n\r\nIcons: http://www.clker.com\r\n\r\nLibVLC 1.1.9: http://www.videolan.org/\r\n\r\nMediaInfo DLL 0.7.51 by Jerome Martinez: http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net\r\n\r\nMovie Details API: http://api.themoviedb.org\r\n\r\nMovie Thumbnailer 200808a: http://moviethumbnail.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\nTagLib# 2.1.0.0: https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp\r\n\r\nTV Show Details API: http://services.tvrage.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.voyamedia.com | http://www.voyamedia.org | http://www.jammary.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
